# Spring Boot Security Starter Structure

This project contains a **ready-to-use Spring Security configuration** for Spring Boot applications. You can copy and paste this structure into your own projects to quickly enable modern, JWT-based authentication and authorization.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication** — Secure endpoints with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Custom UserDetailsService** — Flexible user loading from your own data source.
- **Stateless Security** — No sessions; works perfectly for REST APIs.
- **Exception Handling** — Custom responses for unauthorized and forbidden requests.
- **Password Encoding** — Uses BCrypt for password security.
- **Easily Extensible** — Add or change endpoints and logic as needed.
